## Project Files Explanation

### 1. `app.py`

This is the main application file for the Flask web service.

- **Purpose**: It contains the Flask application logic, including routes for submitting and retrieving scores from the MySQL database.
- **Key Components**:
  - Initializes the Flask app and SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
  - Defines the `Score` model, which represents the `scores` table in the database.
  - Implements two endpoints:
    - `/submit_score`: Accepts a POST request to submit a user's score.
    - `/scores`: Accepts a GET request to retrieve all submitted scores.

### 2. `requirements.txt`

This file lists the Python dependencies required for the application.

- **Purpose**: To specify which packages need to be installed for the application to run correctly.
- **Contents**: Includes libraries such as:
  - `Flask`: The web framework used to build the application.
  - `Flask-SQLAlchemy`: An extension that simplifies SQLAlchemy usage with Flask.
  - `PyMySQL`: The database driver used to connect to a MySQL database.
  - `cryptography`: Required for certain MySQL authentication methods.

### 3. `Dockerfile`

This file defines the environment in which the Flask application runs.

- **Purpose**: To create a Docker image for the application, allowing it to run consistently across different environments.
- **Key Components**:
  - Uses an official Python image.
  - Sets up the working directory and installs dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
  - Copies the application code and exposes the application port (5000).
  - Defines the command to run the application.

### 4. `docker-compose.yml`

This file orchestrates the multi-container application, including both the Flask app and the MySQL database.

- **Purpose**: To define and manage the services that make up the application, enabling easy deployment and scaling.
- **Key Components**:
  - Defines two services: `flask-app` and `db`.
  - The `flask-app` service builds the Docker image, sets environment variables, and depends on the `db` service.
  - The `db` service uses the MySQL image, sets up the database, and mounts an initialization SQL file.

### 5. `init.sql`

This SQL script initializes the database schema.

- **Purpose**: To set up the necessary database tables and structures when the MySQL container starts for the first time.
- **Contents**: Contains SQL commands to create the `scores` table, defining its structure and constraints.

### 7. `README.md`

This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the application.

- **Purpose**: To serve as the primary documentation for users and developers, explaining how to set up, run, and interact with the application.
- **Contents**: Includes sections for features, technologies, installation instructions, API endpoints, and file explanations.

### 8. `example-frontend.md`

This file show a example about how interacts with the Flask API for the frontend (if applicable).

- **Purpose**: To handle user input and communicate with the Flask API for submitting and retrieving scores.
- **Key Components**:
  - Uses `fetch` to send POST requests to submit scores and GET requests to retrieve scores from the API.
  - Updates the user interface with the retrieved scores.
